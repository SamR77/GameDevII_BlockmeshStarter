TODO:

- Add keyboard shortcuts to allows playtesting of levels quickly
- Seperate GameManager from title screen, Spawn in on game Title Screen load *(issue with returning to title screen, Game manager is duplicate and gives warnings... maybe destroying Game Manager when loading title screen is an easier way to address this.)
- add credits for fonts used
- add credits screen
- add subscreens for QUIT and Return to Menu... "Are you sure you want to return to title screen?   [Yes]   [No]"
